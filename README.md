- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kirknasty54
I am currently a senior in college majoring in Computer Science, specifically game development. I am taking on my coding journey and hoping to eventually make something from it! I've always enjoyed computers and technology and hope to one day make a career out of it in some form or another.
